          Currently I am:
          <br>
           - Finishing my Masters' in AI at Stanford having previously completed my undergrad in Computer Science also at Stanford
           <br>
           - Evaluating user outcomes from LLM conversations and building guardrails to steer LLMs to prioritize user wellbeing with PhD Candidate <a href="https://myracheng.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Myra Cheng</a> at the NLP Group

          I'm previously interned at Waymo working on agents and The New York Times (with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-sieh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">bylines</a> !) as a engineer on Interactive News and AI Initiatives. I've helped publish research in robotics and edtech, and led independent research project on <a href="https://philippine-presstitutes.github.io/">online violence faced by Filipina journalists</a>. I am also a <a href="https://campkaleidoscope.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">camp</a> counselor for kids with a parent cancer experience (and raised <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIrYn10PYC-/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">60k</a> for it). When I was young, I started a nationwide <a href="https://coding.ph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">coding school</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aca7CaMGAII" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">girls coding organization</a>, both which run independently today.

              I took on multiple roles in the ongoing AI literacy project, currently called <a href="https://craft.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Classroom-Ready Resources About AI For Teaching (CRAFT)</a>. I created the entire curriculum for the AI & Math Unit including teaching resources. I developed 2 interactive tools (Datamax and Analyze), and the Resources tab of explorable AI literacy resources using technologies including Typescript, GoogleAPI, and Observable. I also facilitated classroom sessions, and conducted multiple co-design and user testing interviews on our curriculum and CRAFT website. This project was presented at the CHI AI literacy workshop and appeared in 4 papers, one of which I am cited as author.            <p><a href="https://https://philippine-presstitutes.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read article →</a></p>
